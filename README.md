# Vehicle-Hatzerim

my (still in the works) **Main project**  
the project for now in the most basic version works fine.  
but there's a lot more to do in order to make it execoitonable.

## To Do:

- Reason table modifier.
- Vehicle table modifier.
- User manager.

I want to Add to the add vehicle page the table I added for the  
vehicle schedual page which there's a specific table  
that takes two dates.

- **OR** Find a way to get the starting date and corolate it with  
  the right hour
- **OR** maybe try just to make the current format nicer to the  
  eye via css and conclude it there.

Change the language from **English** to **Hebrew**.

**There's a need to make the user only take one vehicle at a destiend time.**  
**so he wont be able to take all the vehicles at the same time.**

- I want to add age to the users table  
  and user registrations.

# Things I'm proud of

I'm really proud of the main function of the site which is giving  
the client a vehicle.  
Why?

- if the vehicle is used in the given time then it will not be shown for the  
  availabe vehicles.
- if there's no vehilce availabe the site will say it to the user
- how does the code understads that? well, via SQL request that gives  
  me the relvent information, and through it I understand if the vehicle  
  is availabe.
