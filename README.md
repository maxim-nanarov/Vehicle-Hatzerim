# Vehicle-Hatzerim

my (still in the works) **Main project**  
the project for now in the most basic version works fine.  
but there's a lot more to do in order to make it execoitonable.

## To Do:

- Reason table modifier.
- Vehicle table modifier.
- User manager.

Change the language from **English** to **Hebrew**.

**There's a need to make the user only take one vehicle at a destiend time.**  
**so he wont be able to take all the vehicles at the same time.**

- I want to add age to the users table  
  and user registrations.

- **Change the Took Key row to another color and change the button to Return**  
  **Key button with function that deletes the row from the DB**

# Things I'm proud of

I'm really proud of the main function of the site which is giving  
the client a vehicle.  
Why?

- if the vehicle is used in the given time then it will not be shown for the  
  availabe vehicles.
- if there's no vehilce availabe the site will say it to the user
- how does the code understads that? well, via SQL request that gives  
  me the relvent information, and through it I understand if the vehicle  
  is availabe.

### Through the project I learned about myself, and the way I work.

- How to get the job done when I have the feeling  
  of **burning out**.
- How fun it can be to come up with new ideas and
  implement it to the project.
- allways ask someone who understand little about the  
  project in order to hear other's opinion, it may be  
  a waste of time, but when it's not, it's worth it.
- in order to move forward I need to set myself a specific  
  goal. In order to stay at the needed line of work and  
  progress.
