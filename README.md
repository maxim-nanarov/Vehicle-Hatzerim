# Things I'm proud of

I'm really proud of the main function of the site which is giving
the client a vehicle.
Why?

- if the vehicle is used in the given time then it will not be shown for the
  availabe vehicles.
- if there's no vehilce availabe the site will say it to the user
- how does the code understads that? well, via SQL request that gives
  me the relvent information, and through it I understand if the vehicle
  is availabe.
